Directory structure?

* what is the empty file CATS/ for?
* CNSTRNT/ converts the syntax elements to strings also to pretty printing
* PARSING parses from json 


I think the 
{{{
local
  #include "./SOLVING/patsolve_z3_solving_ctx.dats"
in
  // nothing
end
}}}
pattern includes the raw file in a seperately scoped local file
